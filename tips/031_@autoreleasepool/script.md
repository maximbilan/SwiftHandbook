## 031_@autoreleasepool

The autoreleasepool in Swift is used to manage memory more efficiently, especially when you're creating a lot of temporary objects within a loop. By wrapping the code that creates these objects in autoreleasepool, you ensure that the memory they use is released after each loop iteration. This prevents your app's memory usage from spiking, keeping it more stable and efficient. It's particularly useful in scenarios like image processing or handling large datasets. Think of it as a mini cleanup crew that ensures your memory usage stays under control. Happy coding!

```swift





for _ in 1...10000 {
    @autoreleasepool {
        // Imagine you're creating
        // a bunch of temporary objects
        // They party hard, use memory,
        // and need to be cleaned up
    }
    // After each iteration,
    // the memory used by those objects
    // is freed up,
    // preventing your app's memory usage
    //from skyrocketing
}

```
