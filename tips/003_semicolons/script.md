## Semicolons

Did you know in Swift programming, we don't need to use semicolons? That's right. You don't need to use them. But... There is an interesting opportunity to use it. Semicolons allow you to combine connected elements into a single line.

```swift
import Foundation

func sum(value1: Int, value2: Int) -> Int {
    let sum = value1 + value2
    return sum
}

let total = sum(value1: 1, value2: 2)
```
