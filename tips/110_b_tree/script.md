## Binary tree

Unlike simpler binary trees, B-tree nodes can have multiple keys and children, with the number of keys always being one less than the number of children. This structure aids in efficient search operations, especially for large data sets. The provided code snippet is a basic example of a B-tree node in Swift, showcasing properties like keys, values, children, and a flag to indicate if a node is a leaf. It's a foundational step towards building a complete B-tree, which would include additional methods for insertion, deletion, and searching, offering a taste of the complexities and efficiencies in managing large-scale data in Swift.

```swift
class BTreeNode<Key: Comparable, Value> {
    var keys: [Key] = []
    var values: [Value?] = []
    var children: [BTreeNode?] = []
    var isLeaf: Bool = true

    init(isLeaf: Bool) {
        self.isLeaf = isLeaf
    }

    // Methods for insertion, deletion,
    // and searching would go here
}

// Example of creating a B-tree node
let node = BTreeNode<Int, String>(isLeaf: true)
node.keys = [10, 20, 30]
node.values = ["Ten", "Twenty", "Thirty"]
```
