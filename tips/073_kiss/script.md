## KISS

In Swift, you can write concise and readable code by using higher-order functions like filter and map. The tip demonstrates creating a function, doubleEvens, which efficiently processes an array of integers. This function filters out even numbers and then doubles their values, all in a single, streamlined line of code. It exemplifies how Swift's capabilities can be leveraged for simplicity, making the code not just easier to write, but also more straightforward to read and maintain. This approach aligns perfectly with the KISS principle, emphasizing clarity and brevity in coding.

```swift
func doubleEvens(from numbers: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    return numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }.map { $0 * 2 }
}

let myNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
let doubledEvens = doubleEvens(from: myNumbers)
print(doubledEvens) // Output: [4, 8, 12]
```
